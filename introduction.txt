Backend:
Why did you choose this field (at least 100 chars)?
Answer : figured I would throw in here why I ended up choosing the backend in hopes that it might inform others when making their decision. I was seeking job satisfaction when I made the career switch to being a dev and decided to start out working across the entire stack. I worked as a full-stack dev for 3 years before I started to really shift towards the backend. What drew me to the backend was the cleanliness of Ruby. Javascript and frontend languages have always felt less organized to me. I also thrive on optimizing code performance. I love trying to find ways to make things run better and faster. The backend seemed to give me more opportunities to do that.

Finally, I am not a very visual or artistic person. Some people can look at a webpage and figure out how to lay it out and where everything should go. I never was good at that so the backend felt more natural and comfortable for me.

If you want more insight into other's opinions, check out this CodeNewbie Chat which discusses Frontend vs Backend web development. You can also check out the dev.to thread I started Tuesday asking people what part of the stack they choose to work in and why.

Person4:
Name :- Dhaval Dubariya
Backend:
Why did you choose this field (at least 100 chars)?
Answer : figured I would throw in here why I ended up choosing the backend in hopes that it might inform others when making their decision. I was seeking job satisfaction when I made the career switch to being a dev and decided to start out working across the entire stack. I worked as a full-stack dev for 3 years before I started to really shift towards the backend. What drew me to the backend was the cleanliness of Ruby. Javascript and frontend languages have always felt less organized to me. I also thrive on optimizing code performance. I love trying to find ways to make things run better and faster. The backend seemed to give me more opportunities to do that.
